LICENSE FOR GAWNUTS:

GAWNUTS is based in AWNUTS, which is based in several things. Seeing the code
still resident, and wanting to come up with the less restricyive license, we
came up with this three easy steps:

1) The .version can be modified but all its info must be there, and the 
   command avaliable.
2) You can't sell GAWNUTS This INCLUDES modified source.
3) If wish to sell something don't include ANY of this code in whatever it is 
   unless you ask permission to GAWNUTS staff and that is granted.
